I am currently the head of department at the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket), within the Division of Information and Communication Technology, managing a department of more than 60 project leaders, software engineers, test leaders, requirement specialists and managers. Except my full-time work, I am also working towards a PhD in cryptography, under the supervision of associate professor [Łukasz Krzywiecki](https://cs.pwr.edu.pl/krzywiecki/), [Wrocław University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/). My main research focus is secure group oriented signature and encryption schemes for connected and distributed infrastructures such as VANET and smart railway eco-systems. Particular interests within cryptography are provable security, signature schemes, secret sharing and cryptographic accumulators. I am also working towards a PhD in microdata analysis at [Dalarna University](https://www.du.se/en), under the supervision of professor [Yves Rybarczyk](https://www.du.se/en/profile-page/?userId=1998846526). My research topic is data-driven decision management in software engineering, with a particular focus on management decision makers, combining organizational- and management theory with statistical analysis and data science.  

I have more than 7 years of experience as a security software engineer with focus on IT-security and secure software development. I previously worked as technical lead and later head of API development Sweden, at Nordea Bank, and before that as a software security consultant and software engineer. I have primarily worked with (IT-security) projects in the finance/banking and infrastructure domain. 

In my spare time, excluding research, I spend a lot of time with my family, running, weightlifting, hiking, cross-country skiing, reading fiction, philosophy and mathematics, and occasionally play and construct board games.
