I am currently the head of department (leading leaders) of Digitalization and Transportation Systems at the Swedish Transport Administration (STA), within the Division of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), managing a department of more than 400 software engineers, test leaders, requirement specialists, architects, project leaders, engineering managers and many other roles. Except my full-time work at STA, I am also working towards a PhD in cryptography, under the supervision of associate professor [Łukasz Krzywiecki](https://cs.pwr.edu.pl/krzywiecki/) at the [Wrocław University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/). My main research focus is secure multi-party signature schemes for connected and distributed infrastructures such as VANET and smart railway eco-systems. Particular interests within cryptography are provable security, signature schemes, and cryptographic accumulators. I am also working towards a PhD in [data analytics](https://www.du.se/en/research/doctoral-studies/doctoral-programme-in-microdata-analysis/) at [Dalarna University](https://www.du.se/en), under the supervision of professor [Yves Rybarczyk](https://www.du.se/en/profile-page/?userId=1998846526). My research topic is data-driven decision management in software engineering and (agile) software development, with a particular focus on inter- and transdisciplinary methods for managerial decision-making, combining organizational- and management theory with statistical analysis and data science.  

I have more than **7 years** of experience as a security software engineer and system developer with focus on IT-security and secure software development, and **6 years** of experience as a manager including middle- and top management levels. I have primarily worked within finance and banking, and more recently the transport infrastructure domain. For a more detailed summary of my professional activities, [go here](roles.md). **Since 2021 I am holding a senior IEEE membership**.

In my spare time, excluding research, I spend a lot of time with my family, running, weightlifting, hiking, cross-country skiing, training karate and thai boxing, reading fiction, philosophy and mathematics, and occasionally play and construct board games.

## Thesis Supervising

Supervision and mentoring of master and bachelor thesis student projects with topics primarily on cryptography and IT-security. My contribution included the specification of problem statements, ideas for research, supervising students in research methodology, scientific writing and cryptography. The main responsibilities except supervising activities, was to announce and execute projects, interview candidates and jointly with academia approve resulting master thesis reports.
