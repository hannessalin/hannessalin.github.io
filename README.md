## Hannes Salin
Head of Unit at Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket), within the Department of Information and Communication Technology, managing a unit of more than 60 project leaders, software engineers, test leaders, requirement specialists and team managers. Except my full-time work, I am also working towards a PhD in cryptography, under the supervision of associate professor [Łukasz Krzywiecki](https://cs.pwr.edu.pl/krzywiecki/), Wrocław University of Science and Technology. My main research focus is on secure proxy-based signature and encryption schemes for connected and distributed infrastructures such as smart railways and VANET eco-systems. Particular interests within cryptography are provable security, signcryption, signature schemes, secret sharing and cryptographic accumulators.

I have more than 7 years of experience as a security software engineer with focus on IT-security and secure software development. I previously worked as technical lead and later head of API development Sweden, at Nordea Bank, and before that as a software security consultant and software engineer. I have primarily worked with (IT-security) projects in the finance/banking and infrastructure domain. Technology stacks and areas of expertise/experience are software development in {C/C++, Java, Python, Rust}, crypto development with {jPBC, MCL, BouncyCastle, JCA}, Spring/Spring Boot, Thales Hardware Security Modules, Docker, Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) development and test automation.

In my spare time, excluding research, I spend a lot of time with my family, running, weightlifting, hiking, cross-country skiing, reading fiction, philosophy and mathematics, and occasionally play and construct board games.

## Projects

I have supervised 11 master thesis projects since 2017, with topics primarily on cryptography and IT-security. My contribution included the specification of problem statements, ideas for research, supervising students in research methodology, scientific writing and cryptography.
